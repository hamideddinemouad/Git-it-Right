very powerful command that check if all branches are the same as the repo 

example

  
   main                            3611884 [origin/main] cleanup
   this for example means that main is uptodate (same commit in local same as cloud)
   
   test_git_push_n                 5ec25bc now devfile is part of dev
   this means that test_git_push_n only have a commit localy

   main  c6ebabf [origin/main: ahead 3] git branch -vv
   this means that main is localy ahead with  commits
